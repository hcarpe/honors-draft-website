      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">Fanfiction (often called a “fic” for short) is fiction written by fans about the fandom they are a part of. Because fanfiction can be written about virtually anything, a fanfiction’s “canon” is the original source from which the fanfiction draws its inspiration, such as a book or TV show. The fanfiction itself combines with other fanfiction about a canon to form a “fanon,” which consists of the fanfiction works themselves and the fannish theories that inspire them. There cannot be fanfiction without source material; thus, the canon must come before the fanon, and as a result, fanfiction has long been considered linearly derivative of its canon.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Yet, as scholar Abigail Derecho notes, instead of being “derivative” or “appropriative” fanfiction is “archontic,” meaning that the universe any piece of art exists in (its canon and respective fanon) is “ever-expanding and never completely closed” (Derecho 61). In other words, because fanfiction is inspired by fannish desires, a fanon is fluid and unaffected by more rigid boundaries associated with the notion of  “canon.” Derecho notes that such archontic literature has existed as early as the seventeenth century and is often used by women and other marginalized groups to make social and cultural criticism.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Because fanfiction is “always overtly written in relation to its canon,” fanfiction relies on readers’ knowledge of a relation to a canon text (Leavenworth). Leavenworth expands on Derecho’s idea of fanfiction being archontic literature by suggesting that fanfiction is also written in relation to other fan’s knowledge and writings (Leavenworth 42). If fanfiction is based on both its canon and the fanfiction that came before it, any given fanfiction repertoire is truly ever-expanding and never closed, according to Maria Leavenworth.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Fanfiction relates to its canon by changing or expanding upon specific aspects of canon in order to fulfill fannish desires, or “kinks.” Kinks need not be sexual, but rather a “situation, type of relationship, action, image or sentiment capable of producing the greatest impact on a particular fandom reader.” In their research, Natalia Sumatina notes that kinks “compel many a fandom reader to read aesthetically compromised texts, or texts they are not happy with for some other reason” simply because their kink is present (Sumatina 264, 265). In order to bring their kinks to life, fans often “transmotivize” a canon by giving their own characters motivations lacking in the canon. Writers can amplify aspects of the canon by exaggerating them and making them the focal point of their story; similarly, writers can also reduce other aspects of the canon by making them less relevant in their story or removing them altogether. Writers can express their kinks in longer fics, but it is also popular for fanfiction authors to write kinks into bite-sized, one-chapter stories known as “one-shots,” perfect for short-term reader gratification. In some cases, a particular kink could involve situating characters into an alternate universe by envisioning them in a different setting or giving them a different fate than originally written (Leavenworth).</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">Another popular type of kink is a “ship,” originating from the term “relationship,” in which fans express their support for a relationship not included in the canon. Fanfiction’s first famous ship was Star Trek’s Spock and Kirk in the 1960s and 70s, reflecting fan desires to see a homoerotic sexual relationship between two characters presented as cisgender and heterosexual in the canon. Spock and Kirk make the “ship” itself, and the fans who ship them together are called “shippers” (Sumatima). Ships are prominently featured in slash fics, a subgenre of fanfiction that features characters from a canon in fictional, same-sex relationships (Fathallah).</div>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">In addition to theoretical justifications for fanfiction's legitimacy in a world of intertextuality, scholars have argued for the practice's legitimacy by highlighting the ways in which fanfiction helps young women develop creatively and linguistically. Scholars such as Betsy Rosenblatt, Rebecca Tushnet, Monica Flegel, and Jenny Roth explore the legitimacy and validity of young, mostly female, and often inexperienced writers creating original content entirely based on other people’s professional work. Central to the argument about fanfiction’s legitimacy is the Organization for Transformative Works (OTF for short), a nonprofit, founded in 2007, whose vision was a “future in which all fannish works are recognized as legal and transformative and are accepted as a legitimate creative activity. We are proactive and innovative in protecting and defending our work from commercial exploitation and legal challenge” (Flegel 1093). The OTW sought to creatively legitimize fanfiction because legal legitimization would threaten copyright holders. By doing so, the OTW also moved to protect marginalized fanfiction creators from being commercially challenged by copyright holders.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">From handmade magazines discussing fandom opinions and trends in the mid 20th century to a diverse digital space in the 21st century, fanfiction has grown in popularity and evolved with technology. <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="blank">Fanfiction.net</a> (FFN for short) was founded in 1998 as the first online fanfiction platform. FFN served as an online hub for all fandoms. Its interface is simple and utilizes text, user comments, and user likes as a way for fandoms to share their work with the world at large (see Figure 1).</div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">Fanfiction.net opened the door for online fan activity and creativity to explode, but other platforms developed in its wake are responsible for allowing fans to use more modern technologies in their writing. The internet was certainly less technically sophisticated in 1998 compared to the present. Fanfiction.net has notably kept its platform largely the same since its founding, which explains the simplicity of FFN’s interface. At the time of fanfiction.net’s creation—a time when online fanfiction existed largely as  “wholly text-based objects,”—the difference between online platforms was marginal. Over time, however, as online reading platforms have grown in technical sophistication, so have the differences between online fanfiction platforms. Ellen McCracken argues that the “medium in which … text appears is not neutral” because “the text’s materiality changes the sense readers make of the ‘same’ content” (Leavenworth 45). Similarly, I argue that each different fanfiction platform is its own medium and that each platform’s differences change a reader’s experience. In my thesis, I focus on two newer and more technically-infused platforms, Archive of Our Own and Wattpad.</div>

Ao3 had about 2.5 million users as of May 2020, over 37,700 fandoms as of December 2020, and over 7 million fanworks as of December 2020.

Although the platform was founded before Archive of Our Own, Wattpad has since differentiated itself from other online fanfiction websites by marketing itself as a premier tech-savvy writing platform. Having garnered a monthly audience of over 90 million users, Wattpad launched its app in 2008, prompting the Wattpad team to double in size and launching growth that would allow the platform to register its 1 millionth user in 2011 (Wattpad).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">Wattpad boasts an in-line commenting interface throughout stories and the ability to insert multimedia elements (as shown in Image 3). Wattpad also has a mobile app, something Archive of Our Own does not. As of January 2014, 53% of Wattpad users had written a story on their phone; as of October 2017, 90% of the time users spent on Wattpad was from a mobile device. Unsurprisingly, Wattpad’s audience is over 90% composed of Gen Z and Millenials.</div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">As the screenshots shared illustrate well, the elements that differentiate one particular digital fanfiction platform from another are their design patterns. The back button on an internet browser is an example of a “design pattern,” or a “general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design,” invented in order to solve the problem of not being able to retrace one’s steps when browsing online (SourceMaking). Design patterns lend themselves to multimodal affordances. Scott M. Voss defines multimodal as “the use of different modes of communication, like speech, writing, image, gesture, and sound to represent or make meaning in the world” and an affordance as “what an environment has to offer an organism” (Voss). Put together, a multimodal affordance is a mode of communication that offers something to an organism in its specific environment. In terms of online fanfiction, multimodal affordances are what a platform’s specific design patterns offer that platform’s readers.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">While both Ao3 and Wattpad have tag, like, multimedia, and comment design patterns, each platform implements these common patterns differently than the other and thus offers a different affordance to their users. This is similar to how social media platforms Instagram and Facebook both have a “like” function but implement it differently; Instagram by double-tapping the post or tapping a heart icon below the picture, and Facebook by tapping a thumbs-up icon at the bottom of a post.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">“Tags” allow readers to search through a platform’s “library” by genre or, in the case of fanfiction, fandom and kink. Users can search for a specific fandom such as One Direction or Harry Potter. Likewise, users can search for a kink such as a homosexual relationship, often tagged “boyxboy” or “bxb”, or a specific relationship such as Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, tagged “Dramione” to represent the mashup of Draco and Hermione’s names. The tag function is virtually the same on both Ao3 and Wattpad, with authors tagging their works and readers searching for a specific tag they want to read.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">The “like” function is a way for readers to show support for a work of fanfiction. On Ao3, readers can “kudo” a story they enjoy by clicking the “kudos” button at the end of a work’s chapters. On Wattpad, readers can “vote” for specific chapters of a work in the corner of the web page, and the total number of votes are shown on the work’s “about” page. The icon for Ao3 Kudos is a heart while the icon used to denote votes on Wattpad is a star.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">Another design pattern both Ao3 and Wattpad use is the insertion of multimedia elements directly into works. Social media websites such as Tumblr and Twitter have long been home to fan lore, theories, and multimedia edits. Ranging from photoshopped pictures, to memes, to video footage, these edits both allow fans to express their admiration for a canon and serve as a way for fans to visualize their fanfictions. Oftentimes, fans use these edits as inspiration for and supplements to their fics, and Archive of Our Own and Wattpad have updated their interfaces to accommodate these edits in stories. While on Ao3 an author can only post a picture at the beginning of a chapter, Wattpad users can insert videos at the beginning of a chapter as well as pictures and gifs anywhere in a chapter, as seen in the previous example.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent offset-3">The design pattern that differs most between Ao3 and Wattpad is the reader comment function. Much like social media, readers are able to comment on the fics they are reading. On Ao3, shown in Figure 4, readers may comment at the end of specific chapters.</div>

For example, Natalia Samutina studied how the Russian Harry Potter fanfiction community’s reading practices aligned with common contemporary reading practices. In her own Abbott Honors thesis, Jillian Farrell looked at cycles of positivity in online fanfiction communities by analyzing reader comments on Percy Jackson fanfiction. While Sumatina found that contemporary fanfiction readers are immensely emotionally invested in the fanfiction that they read, Farrell looked at how that emotionality presented itself in reader comments and determined that readers intentionally fostered an overwhelmingly positive environment on Archive of Our Own in order to create a sense of community on the platform.</div>
