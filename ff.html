      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Fanfiction is fiction written by fans about the fandom they are a part of, often called a “fic” for short. Because fanfiction can be written about virtually anything, a fanfiction’s “canon” is the original source from which the fanfiction draws its inspiration, such as a book or TV show. The fanfiction itself combines with other fanfiction about a canon to form a “fanon,” which consists of the fanfiction works themselves and the fannish theories that inspire them. There cannot be fanfiction without source material; thus, the canon must come before the fanon, and as a result, fanfiction has long been considered linearly derivative of its canon.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Central to scholarly discourse surrounding fanfiction is Abigail Derecho. Derecho legitimizes the practice of fanfiction by arguing against popular negative connotations of fanfiction being “derivative” or “appropriative.” Instead, Derecho argues that fanfiction is “archontic,” meaning that the universe any piece of art exists in (its canon and respective fanon) is “ever-expanding and never completely closed” (Derecho 61). In other words, because fanfiction is inspired by fannish desires, a fanon is fluid and unaffected by more rigid boundaries associated with the notion of  “canon”. Derecho notes that archontic literature has existed as early as the seventeenth century and is often used by women and other marginalized groups to make social and cultural criticism. </div>

      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Another notable fanfiction scholar is Maria Leavenworth. Leavenworth explains how fanfiction interacts with its canon by using “hypotext” to mean an earlier text and “hypertext” to mean a newer text that has been related to the hypotext. In fanfiction, the hypotext is the canon and the hypertext is the fanfiction. Because fanfiction is “always overtly written in relation to its canon,” it depends on readers’ knowledge of a relation to a canon text. Leavenworth expands on Derecho’s idea of fanfiction being archontic literature by suggesting that fanfiction is also written in relation to other hypertexts, or other fan’s knowledge and writings (Leavenworth 42). If fanfiction is based on both its canon and the fanfiction that came before it, any given fanfiction repertoire is truly ever-expanding and never closed.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Fanfiction relates to its canon by changing or expanding upon specific aspects in order to fulfill fannish desires, or “kinks.” In order to bring their kinks to life, fans often “transmotivize” a canon by giving their own fanfiction works motivations lacking in the canon. For example, writers can amplify aspects of the canon by exaggerating them and making them the focal point of their story; similarly, writers can also reduce other aspects of the canon by making them less relevant in their story or removing them altogether. Writers can express their kinks in longer fics, but it is also popular for fanfiction authors to write kinks into bite-sized, one-chapter stories known as “one-shots,” perfect for short-term reader gratification. In some cases, a particular kink could involve situating characters into an alternate universe by envisioning them in a different setting or giving them a different fate than originally written (Leavenworth). Another popular type of kink is a “ship,” originating from the term “relationship,” in which fans express their support for a relationship not included in the canon. Fanfiction’s first famous ship was Star Trek’s Spock and Kirk in the 1960s and 70s, reflecting fan desires to see a homoerotic sexual relationship between two characters presented as cisgender and heterosexual in the canon. Spock and Kirk make the “ship” itself, and the fans who ship them together are called “shippers” (Sumatima). Ships are prominently featured in slash fics, a subgenre of fanfiction that features characters from a canon in fictional, same-sex relationships (Fathallah).</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Earlier scholarly writings on fanfiction attempt to legitimize the practice by highlighting the ways in which fanfiction helps young women develop creatively and linguistically. Scholars such as Betsy Rosenblatt, Rebecca Tushnet, Monica Flegel, and Jenny Roth explore the legitimacy and validity of young, mostly female, and often inexperienced writers creating original content entirely based on other people’s professional work. Central to the argument about fanfiction’s legitimacy is the Organization for Transformative Works (OTF for short), a nonprofit, founded in 2007, whose vision was a “future in which all fannish works are recognized as legal and transformative and are accepted as a legitimate creative activity. We are proactive and innovative in protecting and defending our work from commercial exploitation and legal challenge” (Flegel 1093). The OTW sought to creatively legitimize fanfiction because legal legitimization would threaten copyright holders. By doing so, the OTW also moved to protect marginalized fanfiction creators from being commercially challenged by copyright holders.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">From handmade magazines discussing fandom opinions and trends in the mid 20th century to a diverse digital space in the 21st century, fanfiction has grown in popularity and evolved with technology. Fanfiction.net (FFN for short) was founded in 1998 as the first online fanfiction platform. FFN served as an online hub for all fandoms, and as you can see below its interface was simple and utilized text, user comments, and user likes as a way for fandoms to share their work with the world at large.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The internet was certainly not as technically sophisticated in 1998 as it is today. Fanfiction.net has notably kept its platform largely the same since its founding, which explains the simplicity in FFN’s interface. Ellen McCracken argues that the “medium in which … text appears is not neutral,” even at a time when online fanfictions existed “predominantly as wholly text-based objects” (Leavenworth 45). As online reading platforms have grown in technical sophistication, the medium in which text appears has become increasingly less neutral. FFN might have opened the door for online fan activity and creativity to explode, but other platforms developed in its wake are responsible for allowing fans to use more modern technologies in their writing. In my thesis, I will be focusing on two newer and more technically-infused platforms, Archive of Our Own and Wattpad.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Archive of Our Own, also known as Ao3, was founded in 2008 by The Organization for Transformative Works. Ao3 had about 2.5 million users as of May 2020, over 37,700 fandoms as of December 2020, and over 7 million fanworks as of December 2020. Like FFN, Ao3 has largely remained true to its founding interface of plain text and a reader comment forum at the end of each chapter, but Ao3 has since added the ability to insert multimedia elements such as pictures and video attachments directly into stories. Below, you can see the cover page for a One Direction fanfiction titled <i>Young & Beautiful</i> on Archive of Our Own.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Wattpad was founded in 2006 with a vision to “change the way we share stories'' (BrainStation). Although the platform was founded before Archive of Our Own, Wattpad has since differentiated itself from other online fanfiction websites by marketing itself as a premier tech-savvy writing platform. On their website, Wattpad details just how they use groundbreaking technology to “set stories free into a world of unbridled possibility;” garnering a monthly audience of over 90 million users, Wattpad’s “Story DNA Machine Learning technology allows the company to discover stand-out stories among more than one billion uploads written on the platform” (Wattpad). The Wattpad launched an app in 2008, prompting the Wattpad team to double in size and launching growth that would allow the platform to register their 1 millionth user in 2011.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Wattpad boasts an in-line commenting interface throughout stories and the ability to insert multimedia elements (as you can see in the above image). Wattpad also has a mobile app, something Archive of Our Own does not. As of January 2014, 53% of Wattpad users had written a story on their phone; as of October 2017, 90% of the time users spent on Wattpad was from a mobile device. Unsurprisingly, Wattpad’s audience is over 90% composed of Gen Z and Millenials.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The elements that differentiate one particular digital fanfiction platform from another are their design patterns. SourceMaking.com was created in 2006 as a source for coders to “perfect their knowledge and programming skills”. Today, SourceMaking is dedicated to teaching software engineers good design pattern strategies, defining a “design pattern” as being “a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design” (SourceMaking). The back button on an internet browser is an example of a design pattern invented in order to solve the problem of not being able to retrace one’s steps when browsing online.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Design patterns lend themselves to multimodal affordances. Scott M. Voss defines multimodal as “the use of different modes of communication, like speech, writing, image, gesture, and sound to represent or make meaning in the world” and an affordance as “what an environment has to offer an organism” (Voss). Put together, a multimodal affordance is a mode of communication that offers something to an organism in its specific environment. In terms of online fanfiction, multimodal affordances are what a platform’s specific design patterns offer that platform’s readers.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">While both Ao3 and Wattpad have tag, like, multimedia, and comment design patterns, each platform implements these common patterns differently than the other and thus offers a different affordance to their users. This is similar to how social media platforms Instagram and Facebook both have a “like” function but implement it differently; Instagram by double-tapping the post or tapping a heart icon below the picture, and Facebook by tapping a thumbs-up icon at the bottom of a post.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">“Tags” allow readers to search through a platform’s “library” by genre or, in the case of fanfiction, fandom and kink. Users can search for a specific fandom such as One Direction or Harry Potter. Likewise, users can search for a kink such as a homosexual relationship, often tagged “boyxboy” or “bxb”, or a specific relationship such as Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger, tagged “Dramione” to represent the mashup of Draco and Hermione’s names. The tag function is virtually the same on both Ao3 and Wattpad, with authors tagging their works and readers searching for a specific tag they want to read.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The “like” function is a way for readers to show support for a work of fanfiction. On Ao3, readers can “kudo” a story they enjoy by clicking the “kudos” button at the end of a work’s chapters. On Wattpad, readers can “vote” for specific chapters of a work in the corner of the web page, and the total number of votes are shown on the work’s “about” page. The icon for Ao3 Kudos is a heart while the icon used to denote votes on Wattpad is a star.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Another design pattern both Ao3 and Wattpad use is the insertion of multimedia elements directly into works. Social media websites such as Tumblr and Twitter have long been home to fan lore, theories, and multimedia edits. Ranging from photoshopped pictures, to memes, to video footage, these edits both allow fans to express their admiration for a canon and serve as a way for fans to visualize their fanfictions. Oftentimes, fans use these edits as inspiration for and supplements to their fics, and Archive of Our Own and Wattpad have updated their interfaces to accommodate these edits in stories. While on Ao3 an author can only post a picture at the beginning of a chapter, Wattpad users can insert videos at the beginning of a chapter as well as pictures and gifs anywhere in a chapter, as seen in the previous example.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The design pattern that differs most between Ao3 and Wattpad is the reader comment function. Much like social media, readers are able to comment on the fics they are reading. In her own Abbott Honors thesis, Jillian Farrell looks at cycles of positivity in online fanfiction communities and determines that the vast majority of comments found are positive (Farrell).</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">On Ao3, seen below, readers have to wait until the end of a specific chapter in order to comment.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">On Wattpad, however, readers can comment on specific lines of the story they are reading instead. Each line of text in the Wattpad excerpt below has over 150 comments, while the Ao3 excerpt above has 270 total comments for that specific chapter.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Scholars have looked at the affect of communal online literature on classroom literacy and learning, as well as how fanfiction writing and different fanfiction platforms appear to improve or hinder the development of these skills (Magnifico, Curwood, and Lammers; Malluhi; McEneaney; Korobkova and Black; Thomas; Voss). Discourse specifically about online fanfiction exists as well, with scholars reserarching the interactions of the fanfiction community on specific online platforms. Scholars have also analyzed how reading online fanfiction compares to traditional reading and writing methods, but never compared two different online fanfiction platform experiences (Bruner, Sumatina).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">In 2017, Kodlee Yin, Cecilia Aragon, Sarah Evans, and Katie Davis released a meta-dataset of the world’s largest fanfiction repository at the time, unnamed due to privacy concerns. The researchers “hope to make generally available a fully anonymized, rich dataset about a highly popular but understudied phenomenon” (Yin et al. 6109).</div>
