      <div class="col-lg-6"><span class="subtitle">Abstract:</span><p class="indent">Online fanfiction platforms have come a long way from their early internet beginnings and incorporated a lot of new social media-esque technical features along the way. Past research suggests that these communities are emotionally driven, extremely supportive of one another, and centered around fanfiction authors and their stories. While scholars have analyzed how authors and readers interact with each other on these platforms, there is little research into how readers interact with other readers. Through the lens of One Direction “Larry” fanfiction, I explore reader interaction on two fanfiction platforms, Archive of Our Own and Wattpad, by analyzing reader comments from each platform. By doing so, I discover that fannish reading practices vary between platforms. The comments I analyzed on Archive of Our Own were consistent with prior research, but the comments I coded on Wattpad indicate that small subgroups of fandoms might be more interested in creating a sense of community amongst one another than with the author of a fanfiction work.</p></div>
