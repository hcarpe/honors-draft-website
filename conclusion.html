      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">My analysis of the two fanfictions relies on an analysis of my coding and my own observations while coding the comments. Even without analysis, a clear divide exists between comments that exist on Archive of Our Own and Wattpad.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent"><i>Young & Beautiful</i> has a largely positive audience commenting to the reader about the story. <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i>, on the other hand, has a majority of readers commenting in response to other readers about things that have nothing to do with the story at hand.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Both <i>Young & Beautiful</i> and <i>Baby, Heaven’s in Your Eyes</i> are canon-compliant works of fanfiction, something Natalia Sumatina notes is important to maintain when seeking positive fan interaction. While Jillian Farrell noticed the sheer volume of positive comments on the fanfictions she coded, all of the fanfictions she read were found on Archive of Our Own. I found a similarly positive number of comments on Ao3, but the comments I coded on Wattpad were significantly less positive. Given how much readers interacted with the story, one might assume that readers did enjoy <i>Baby, Heaven’s in your Eyes</i>. However, I only coded comments as “positive” if they positively reacted to the story. The majority of comments I coded on Wattpad did not do that, so I lack the evidence necessary to claim that their comments are, indeed, positive.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Although the percentage of Ao3 comments coded as “Positive” is roughly equal to the percentage of Ao3 comments coded into the “Story” scope, the percentage of positive comments on Wattpad is not equal to the percentage of Wattpad comments in the “Story” scope. I believe this is because Wattpad readers didn’t discuss their opinions about the story as much as Ao3 readers did. For example, when Louis woke up five minutes before his alarm, Dontactlikeuhateit commented “can't relate, got an exam tomorrow and I'm reading this.” This comment, although expressing general interest and enthusiasm for the story, cannot be coded as positive because it does not express positivity about the story like many Ao3 comments did (The very first comment on <i>Young & Beautiful</i> is “Oh my! I very much enjoy this! I can't wait for more !!!” from user jenn). Dontactlikeuhateit’s comment was coded into both the “Story” and “Other” scope, which helps explain why the “Story” and “Other” scopes are easily the most popular scopes on Wattpad overall.</div>

    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Because <i>Young & Beautiful’s</i> comments are largely about how the author has framed and developed the story, fit matters. Velvetoscar’s readers want to read a story about Larry Stylinson that fits into general fannish perceptions about the Larry relationship, and because Velvetoscar does this readers positively reinforce their writing. Readers want to develop a relationship with Velvetoscar through story discussion, and they direct their comments towards Velvetoscar in hopes of doing so.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Previous research on the One Direction Wattpad community has found that the community is “rife with displays of power, plays for recognition, and struggles to be seen as a real fan” while also allowing members to develop writing and editing skills (Korobkova and Black 630). The readers of <i>Baby, Heaven’s in your Eyes</i> are performative in how they comment, but I found no comments that appeared to address writing or editing skills. Instead, the comments that I coded from Wattpad appeared to be in line with Alecia Marie Magnifico's analysis; that online fanfiction readers act more as supportive cheerleaders for each other than editors for the author, as g0ttabeyou’s comment about their parents commenting on their eating habits demonstrates. Furthermore, Wattpad readers appeared interested in inviting other readers to join the Wattpad community by joining in on conversations, fueled by imitative commenting trends, discussion unrelated to the story, and using elements of the story to discuss their own personal experiences. Readers on Wattpad used <i>Baby, Heaven’s in your Eyes</i> as a jumping-off point to connect with other Larry fans; they wanted to develop a relationship with other One Direction fans, and they appear to intentionally direct their comments away from the author and story in order to garner more reader interaction. By reinforcing other readers’ comments, readers are buying into the fandom and the relationships that come with being a Directioner.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">I cannot say for certain whether or not the placement of the comment feature is why Ao3 comments focus on the fanfiction work, whereas Wattpad appears to have more fannish interaction in the comment section. If I wanted to analyze the specific effects different comment features have on online fanfiction communities, I would have to do more qualitative research into why readers prefer one specific platform’s commenting feature over another as well as look into how comment interactions differ between platforms and other fandoms. Although my research does not prove whether or not the placement of the comment definitively affects how readers engage on an online reading platform, it does suggest that in-line commenting draws a more performative response than other, less immersive commenting features. In addition, I can’t definitively say whether readers join a specific platform because of their preference for a certain type of interaction, but the performativity found in Wattpad’s comments and lack thereof on Archive of Our Own indicates that readers are encouraged to perform a certain way once they find themselves on a specific platform. It should also be noted that my findings are within a very particular group, Larry fans, and a cursory glance at other fandom’s fanfiction suggests age is an important factor in how fans interact with a piece of fanfiction. My findings might not hold within fandoms of more sophisticated literature, who are generally older and more particular about how a story is written.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Because readers can filter stories by topic on both platforms, the readers of both stories are all Larry fans and thus all belong to the same niche subgroup of the One Direction fandom. Figure 16 above showcases my Archive of Our Own and Wattpad data combined. Interestingly, the dominant subgroups from each platform are fairly equal in each category; “Positive” and “Other” in “Positivity,” “Author” and “Reader” in “Directed to,” and “Story” and “Other” in “Scope.” Because each individual platform was so strongly aligned to specific subgroups, the combined data shows how different reader interaction is between Archive of Our Own and Wattpad. My results are significant—if my data wasn’t extremely polarized, the percentages of the combined subgroups would be much more evenly spread out. Even though Archive of Our Own and Wattpad’s comments differ in intent, a lack of “canon” scoped comments exists on both platforms, possibly because readers aren’t engaging with a story for One Direction content, but for the kinds of engagement a reader can gain. This shows that even within a small subgroup such as Larry shippers, readers have found a way to further tailor their reading experience to their liking by intentionally creating even more niche Larry subgenres based on platform.</div>
