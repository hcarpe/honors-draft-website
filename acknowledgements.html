      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">I would like to thank everyone who made this project possible. Without my committee, this project wouldnâ€™t exist. My advisor, Dr. Shireen Campbell, ignited my interest in studying fanfiction in a class I took with her sophomore year, and I am so fortunate she has lent me her knowledge, insights, and guidance for this project. I am incredibly grateful that my reader, Owen Mundy, agreed to take on an English Honors thesis as a Digital Studies professor; because of him, I was able to expand this project into the digital studies and gain a hybrid experience that truly encompasses the liberal arts. I would like to thank Dr. Randy Ingram for his guidance, for emphasizing the collaborative nature of this project among my peers, and for classtime snacks, and I would like to acknowledge my Honors peers for lending me their insights and allowing me to grow through watching their own creative processes unfold. Freshman year, a class that I took with Dr. Suzanne Churchill inspired me to consider how technology could enhance my experience in the English department, and I am forever indebted to her for sparking that interest. I would like to thank my friends for listening to me talk about this project and laugh at the many fun comments I read, and I would like to thank my family for always encouraging me to reach for the stars.</div>
