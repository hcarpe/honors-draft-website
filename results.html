The only thing i felt jarring was how Niall was forgiven so easily. Zayn was willing to kill Harry for supposedly giving Liam the drugs but Niall was forgiven? Realistically, Zayn would have broken off his friendship with Niall, and taken a long time to forgive him, perhaps never. Niall being forgiven so soon is the only sore point of this beautiful story.</div>

Most all suggestive comments implored Velvetoscar to incorporate a reader’s desires for Harry and Louis’ relationship into the story, whether that be something as simple as a kiss or more intense such as asking the Velvetoscar to incorporate smut into the story.</div>

How can you be so cruel and write this and do this to your characters. I want to cry through it. Louis deserves the world.” Comments that fell into the “other” category ranged from clarifying questions about the plot to a reader inquiring about other fics to read that would help them “fill the empty hole in [their] chest after reading this fic” (marina).</div>

Explicitly, readers referred to the author by using Velvetoscar, Claire (Velvetoscar’s real name), “you,” or “the author” in their comments. Comments that gave praise to the story such as “this fic is like a proper book. I can't get enough. I'm lovin' it” but failed to address the author outright were still coded as directed towards the author because it can be assumed that a reader intended for the author to read it (Amanda+McEwen). Comments coded as directed towards a “reader” either replied to another reader’s comment or asked readers to respond to a question: “...So if anyone is reading this comment and has already read the book please tell me if there’s smut here!!!...” (harryxfineline). More comments would be directed towards readers if I had coded author comments, but I did not.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">80.4% of comments coded had to do with the story itself, which showed that most people reading <i>Young & Beautiful</i> on Ao3 were interested in discussing the story rather than One Direction, other real-life phenomena, or random topics. The most common type of comment coded into the “story” category was commentary about how the story made readers feel. Readers commented about how the story affected them internally: “...everytime I listen to Lana del Rey's song, it reminds me of this lovely story,” as well as how the story affected them physically: “I smiled, laughed and just genuinely enjoyed every sentence that you wrote!...” (LouisTomlinsonismysun and ObidoneKenobi ). Natalia Sumatina found the vast majority of fan interaction they analyzed to contain excessive emotionality. Although I did not quantify the emotionality of the comments that I coded, I did find readers to be emotional in how they addressed their feelings about the story in their comments, much like Sumatina did.</div>

Readers often took note of how well the songs Velvetoscar suggested—by both One Direction and other artists—fit its specific chapter, some readers going as far as to suggest other well-suited songs. The “Real Life” scope bled into other online platforms as well; some readers commented links to fan art they had made for Velvetoscar on Tumblr and asked them to take a look.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Overwhelmingly, comments from <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i> were neither positive nor negative. Popular “positive” comments were comments that indicated a reader was rereading <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i>, such as ​​rixli03 commenting “rr” (shorthand for “reread”). A comment was coded as having “other” positivity when its sentiment wasn’t explicitly related to the story. For example, tpwkamira’s comment that “i wanna study in england istg” was coded into the “other” category because their expressed desire to study in England is not an attempt by them to give their opinion on <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i>. Although tpwkamira’s comment is reactive to the plot of the story—Louis is discussing his plans to move to London for university—tpwkamira used the plot of the story to share personal details about their own life and neglected to make any sort of commentary on the story in the process. Tpwkamira’s comment relates to the story tangentially, but not explicitly enough to be coded as either “positive” or “negative” towards the story.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">On Wattpad, over half of the comments were directed toward another reader. Comments on Wattpad did not vary much and, at times, appeared to follow a blueprint created by past commenters. One such blueprint consisted of readers commenting their age, grade, and country of origin, like so: “15 10th grade america” (thoufuxkingwanker). After coming back for a re-read, HandHeldPerfection even admitted to participating a second time: “i think i did this last time but whatever. 16, year 10 ( but i dropped out like last week), Australia”. Smileyourepretty, the author of <i>Baby Heaven’s in your Eyes</i>, didn’t reply once within the 4,064 comments I coded; because of a lack of authorial interaction combined with the sheer number of readers that commented on the story, it appears as if Wattpad readers were commenting towards other readers in seek of reader recognition.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Comments found on Ao3 varied noticeably more than comments found on Wattpad; by taking the time to ensure their comments were unique, reflective of a readers’ own beliefs, and about the story, readers on Ao3 were likely to be directing their comments toward Velvetoscar in seek of authorial recognition. The comments I coded from Wattpad only came from the first 8 paragraphs of the story due to a large volume of comments, but I coded all of the comments from Ao3. Figure 13 below depicts the scope of comments from the first chapter of <i>Young & Beautiful</i>. The majority of comments discussed the story, a lack of comments coded as “other,” and over eighty-five percent of the story’s total comments being directed towards the author supports my observation that readers on Ao3 comment in seek of authorial recognition rather than reader engagement.</div>

Readers remember each other from different stories; tobeso_brave remembered onedirectionslut28’s username from a different One Direction fanfiction comment section, writing “HEY IK YOU FROM FLIGHTLESS BIRD,” to which onedirectionslut28 replies “HIIIIII.” A few readers that commented on Wattpad specifically wrote about their preference for Wattpad comment forums: “I literally am an ao3 person but I f00king love reading the comments on wattpad fanfics y’all are the best” (stellayum).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">Oftentimes, “other” scoped reader comments used the story to discuss their own personal lives. When Louis sucks his stomach in because he feels insecure about his belly fat, one user commented “felt that. and my parents seem to have a habit of commenting everything i eat every time we eat. really boosts my confidence” (g0ttabeyouu). A lot of readers commented to the same effect, and many other readers replied with words of camaraderie, affirmation, or both. In the case of g0ttabeyouu, iamraymalik replied “Aaawww... I feel you bestie.... But it's okay.... Remember.. You are loved and don't put yourself down.”</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 offset-3 text-left indent">It is important to remember that some comments were coded under more than one scope. Because of this, a comment coded as falling under “Real Life” could also fall into “Story,” “Canon,” “Other,” or a combination thereof. The pie charts shown in figures 10, 14, and 16 do not account for how much each comment fell under any particular scope; all a comment had to do in order to fall under a specific scope was mention something that fell within that particular scope.</div>
