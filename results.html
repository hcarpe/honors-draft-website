      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">I coded all 4,064 comments from the most popular Larry fanfiction found on Archive of Our Own, <i>Young & Beautiful</i> by Velvetoscar. Of those comments, 3,052 were “positive,” 63 were “positive with a suggestion,” 40 were “positive with a critique,” 14 were “negative,” and 369 fell into the “other” subcategory. 3,017 comments were directed towards the author, 109 comments were directed towards a reader, and 413 comments were directed ambiguously. 3,408 comments were of the “story” scope, 135 were of the “canon” scope, 380 were of the “real life” scope, and 314 comments were coded into the “other” scope subcategory.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Chronologically, the oldest comment I coded was commented on June 14, 2013, the last on December 22, 2021 when I finished transferring comments into my own database. Although readers are still actively reading and commenting on the story, I am only coding comments commented until December 22, 2021.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Comments on <i>Young & Beautiful</i> were overwhelmingly positive. 75% of comments were coded as “positive” while approximately 1.5% were “positive with suggestion,” .98% were “positive with critique,” .34% were “negative,” and 9% were coded as “other”. My findings align well with Jillian Farrell’s own findings that a majority of fanfiction comments will be positive rather than negative.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">74.2% of comments were directed towards the author, 2.6% to the reader, and 10.1% ambiguously. Scope wise, most comments fell under the “story” scope at 83.8%. 9.3% of comments were of the “real life” scope, 7.7% of comments were of the “other” scope, and 3.3% of comments were about the canon. Reading through comments as I coded them, most comments did fall into the “story” scope and were addressed to the author. These comments were positive and praised the author for their work. Some comments went so far as to suggest that Velvetoscar had accurately depicted the Larry ship in a way that the commentor couldn’t have done themselves; these comments were also coded into the “canon” scope. Velvetoscar incorporated songs into their story and some commenters expressed how well the chosen songs fit into the overall story; these comments were coded into the “real life” scope.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Similar to <i>Young & Beautiful</i>, I coded the first 4,064 comments of <i>Baby Heaven’s in your Eyes</i> by smileyourepretty on Wattpad. Of those comments, 71 were “positive,” none were “positive with a suggestion,” 2 were “positive with a critique,” and 3,981 were “other”. 107 comments were directed towards the author, 4,036 to a reader, and 245 were ambiguously directed. In terms of scope, 793 were of the “story” scope, 138 were “canon,” 136 were of the “real life” scope and 3,209 fell into the “other” scope.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The first comment that I coded was commented in 2014 and the last on December 30, 2021. Readers are still actively commenting on <i>Baby Heaven’s in your Eyes</i> as well, but I am only coding comments commented until December 30, 2021. Unlike Archive of Our Own, Wattpad utilizes content warnings for comments that may be offensive.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Comments were overwhelmingly not about the story, with 80.95% of the comments being coded into the “other” scope. Because so many comments weren’t about the story, only 1.75% of comments were positive, there were no positive comments with suggestions and .12% of positive comments had critiques. 97.96% of comments fell into the “other” categtory.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Comments were also overwhelmingly directed towards other readers, with 99.3% of comments being directed to other readers. 6.03% of comments were ambiguously directed and only 2.63% of comments were directed towards the author. It makes sense that so many comments would be directed toward other readers because of how few comments were actually about the story; following the 80.95% of comments of the “other” scope, 19.5% of comments were of the “story” scope, 3.4% of comments were about the canon, and 3.35 comments fell into the “real life” scope. Wattpad commenters commented about the story, but in a different way from Archive of Our Own; instead of commenting on the writing itself, readers commented on how they themselves related to the content being write. For example, readers would comment that they couldn’t relate to Louis’ lavish lifestyle as a rich kid.</div>
