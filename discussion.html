      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">My analysis of the two fanfictions relies on an analysis of my coding and my own observations while coding the comments. Even without analysis, a clear divide exists between comments that exist on Archive of Our Own and Wattpad. Young & Beautiful has a largely positive audience commenting to the reader about the story. Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes, on the other hand, has a majority of readers commenting in response to other readers about things that have nothing to do about the story at hand.</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Because comments about <i>Young & Beautiful</i> are largely about how the author has framed and developed the story in relation to One Direction, fit matters. Velvetoscar’s readers want to read a story about Larry Stylinson that fits into general fannish perceptions about the Larry relationship, and because Velvetoscar does as such readers reinforce their writing. Readers want to develop a relationship with Velvetoscar through story discussion, and they direct their comments towards Velvetoscar in hopes of doing so.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Readers of <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i> are more performative in their commenting practices, shown through imitation and identity reinforcement. Readers want to develop a relationship with other One Direction fans, and they appear to intentionally direct their comments away from the author and story in order to garner more reader interaction. By reinforcing other readers’ comments, readers are buying into the fandom and the relationships that come with being a Directioner.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Because comments on <i>Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes</i> are so performative, it is no surprise that comments on Wattpad might be more entertaining to readers than comments on Archive of Our Own. Readers of Baby Heaven’s In Your Eyes often commented that they enjoyed reading comments on Wattpad more than Archive of Our Own.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">	Even though Archive of Our Own and Wattpad’s comments differ in intent, a lack of “canon” scoped comments on both platforms suggests that commenters on both platforms are performative in some way.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Although my research does not prove whether or not the placement of the comment definitively affects how readers engage on an online reading platform, it does suggest that in-line commenting draws a more performative response than other, less immersive commenting features.</div>
