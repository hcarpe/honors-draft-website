      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">One Direction, often called 1D, is a pop band formed on the seventh season of The X-Factor UK in 2010. While Nial Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson all auditioned as solo artists, judge Simon Cowell is credited with bringing them back to continue competing as a group. One Direction finished third overall and was signed to a record deal with Syco Records, Cowell’s record label, the day after they were eliminated. In September of 2011, the band released their first single ‘That’s What Makes You Beautiful,’ now certified 2x platinum. One Direction released five studio albums and went on four world tours in three years, becoming especially popular amongst teen girls and reaching cultural milestones such as appearing as SNL’s musical guest and starring alongside NFL quarterback Drew Brees in a Pepsi commercial. The band’s untimely end was just as fast as their swift rise to fame, as Zayn announced he was leaving 1D due to stress in March 2015. Although Nial, Liam, Harry, and Louis finished their On The Road Again Tour, the remaining four members confirmed an indefinite hiatus in August 2015 and last performed together on Dick Clark’s New Years Rockin’ Eve on December 31st, 2015. One Direction has been on hiatus ever since, with all five former band members pursuing individual projects of their own. One Direction fans, called “Directioners,” have remained one of the largest and most influential fan bases since the band formed in 2010. Even following the beginning of the band’s hiatus, One Direction fanfiction is still written today. </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">One of the most popular kinks among One Direction fans is the Larry ship, the long-term fan suspicion that bandmates Louis Tomlison and Harry Styles are in a secret relationship. The relationship, dubbed “Larry Stylinson” or “Larry” for short, has been around since shortly after the band formed in 2010 and garnered almost 800,000 online search results in 2015 (Schreiber). In 2016, Vox reported that Larry Stylinson is “bigger than any previous conspiracy theory of its kind,” and although multiple bandmates and other people involved with One Direction have regularly denied any relationship existing, fannish insistence that something exists between Harry and Louis, even today, has led to a strained relationship between the two boys (Romano).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">My foray into the world of One Direction fanfiction was somewhat unorthodox. I have never considered myself a Directioner. In fact, at the time I began reading One Direction fanfiction, I would have considered myself an Anti-Directioner—someone determined to dislike the band simply because of the hubbub surrounding the boys by “girly-girls” who went all googly-eyed at the mere mention of them. I was fourteen, easily influenced by social media and pop culture, and had secretly downloaded Twitter, coincidentally an unofficial hub for Directioner content, after my mother had specifically told me not to. In the Twitterverse, <i>After</i> was all the rage, a story about bad-boy Harry Styles and good-girl Tessa Young’s romantic entanglement at college. Harry Styles was One Direction’s biggest heartthrob and fans often wrote fanfiction romanticizing Harry as a womanizer; a book popular among One Direction fans with a main character named Harry Styles could only be using one person’s likeness, especially if Harry’s picture was the cover art. Two friends had mentioned how hooked they were on the story on the bus, speaking to each other in a way only two teenage girls can when they want to make the third feel left out because they know she isn’t knowledgeable on the topic. I did feel left out, so I downloaded Wattpad that afternoon, started reading, and never stopped.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">I avidly read fanfiction related to the band but never did indoctrinate myself into the fandom. Instead, my fondness for the band has increased as I have spent more time studying the One Direction phenomenon. I find it interesting that the premise of One Direction fanfiction is largely One Direction fans’ own opinions about the band, often interpreted through very public actions and statements made by members of One Direction, their management team, and those closest to them. Looking at the relationship One Direction has with its fans as a parasocial bond has helped me to gain insight into the feelings fans have for the members of the band as well as understand how fans so confidently write real person fiction about members of the band. Rather than being interested in the effect real person fiction has on One Direction, however, I am interested in how real person fiction allows the One Direction fandom to connect amongst themselves.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Technology popularly used in RPF is found in many fandoms, the One Direction fanbase—Larry shippers, even more specifically—being a particularly technical fandom The One Direction fan base had an early and very large presence online, Directioners regularly creating hashtag trends relating to One Direction and posting fan cams to Twitter and other social media platforms. Directioners are young and grew up alongside the modern tech industry boom, leading One Direction fanfiction to exist in large quantities on online fanfiction platforms. Because the One Direction fandom is so technically oriented, I will be using the One Direction fandom as a focus group and the Larry ship as a specific example for my thesis.</div>
