      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">	While current research has detailed the phenomenon that is real person fiction and how RPF allows fannish communities to communicate and grow, I will be looking at what allows the community to do so on online interfaces. In a more academic context, scholars have researched fanfiction’s fast rise in popularity, whether or not interaction with fanfiction contributes to an improvement (or lack thereof) of a student's reading and writing skills on paper, and how online literature affects learning in the classroom (Magnifico, Curwood, and Lammers; Malluhi; McEneaney; Korobkova and Black; Thomas). I, however, am less interested in exploring fanfiction’s effect on intellectual development and more interested in exploring social interaction on fanfiction websites.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Different online fanfiction platforms have different design patterns for various affordances. Since the biggest difference between Wattpad and Ao3’s design patterns is the placement of where readers can comment, I will specifically look at how the placement of the comment feature affects reader communication and engagement. Past research suggests that when utilizing design patterns it is most beneficial for companies to develop company-specific design languages, and both Wattpad and Ao3 have indeed found success using their own, specific design languages (Riehle). Riehle’s assertion isn’t very specific, however, and I am interested in discovering what it is about Wattpad and Ao3’s individual commenting design patterns that differentiate themselves from one another. How will it change how often readers comment, the length of their comments, and what they comment about?</div>

      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">When a reader is actively reading a printed book, they are reading on their own without input from anyone but themselves. When a reader reads a work on Ao3, they are also largely reading on their own, save for the option to comment at the end of each chapter. Wattpad, however, utilizes in-line comments by allowing readers to comment on specific paragraphs rather than wait until the end of a chapter. Readers can (and often do) comment on stories in real-time rather than saving their comments and feedback for the end of a chapter or the work in its entirety. Since comment placement is the biggest differentiating factor between platforms, I will be collecting and analyzing reader comments from the top Larry fanfictions on both platforms in order to determine the effectiveness of each comment placement and, in the process, gain a better understanding of how design patterns in online fanfiction platforms affect the reader experience.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Archive of Our Own’s search function allows users to filter stories by popularity, but Wattpad does not. Because it would take too much time to search through the one-hundred and eighteen thousand Larry fanfictions on Wattpad in order to find the most popular, I chose a Larry fanfiction that was comparatively as popular as the most popular Larry fanfiction on Ao3. The top Larry fic on A03 has just over 4,000 comments; since the Wattpad fic has well over 100,000 comments, I will code the first 4,000 comments of the Wattpad fic as well, excluding the author’s notes (if I had chosen to include the first author’s note, I would have coded over 1,500 comments before the story proper even began).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">I want to analyze the effect of comment placement on reader engagement, so I did not code comments written by the author and it can be assumed that all comments are written by a reader. Comment positivity is not the main metric I am trying to quantify, but I knew the vast majority of comments I coded would be positive (Farrell). My coding scheme was developed to highlight who the comment was directed towards and what the comment was broadly about. I split the coding into three main categories; “general type of comment”, “directed to”, and “scope”.</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Although I am not focusing on how positive a comment is, it will be important to note whether or not overall positivity changes between platforms. As such, the “emotional sentiment” category determines how positive a comment is. The “positive” subgroup indicates a strictly positive response, such as when a user comments “Oh my! I very much enjoy this! I can't wait for more !!!” (Young & Beautiful chapter 1). The “positive with suggestion” subgroup denotes a reader suggesting something they would like to see changed, fixed, or written by the author, an example being a reader expressing their desire to see the story written from another character’s point of view by commenting ​​“i read this fic for like the 10 times (im not even kidding) hope you will write it from Harry's pov x” (Young & Beautiful chapter 1). A comment coded under the “positive with critique” subgroup indicates that the reader praised the fanfiction but also offered some kind of critique about the story as well. An example of a positive with critique comment would be a reader commenting on their dislike of how the author has written a character. In one instance, a reader critiques a character for appropriating Native American culture, writing “i already hate Harry's character here babe... after all the native American necklaces thing, im convinced to hate him till his arc” (Young & Beautiful chapter 9). A comment coded into the “negative” category is strictly negative, such as a user commenting “this chapter is the emotional equivalent of nails on a chalkboard my GOD” (Young & Beautiful chapter 16). I added an “other” subcategory for comments that didn’t fall into any other subcategory. Usually, comments coded into the “other” subcategory often do not comment on the story; rather, they comment on things relating to the story, such as one user noting a song that fits the storyline well by commenting “You should listen to take shelter (unplugged) by years and years. It's great :)” (Young & Beautiful chapter 18).</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The “directed to” category indicates who the comment is directed at. Oftentimes, comments will fall into the “author” or “reader” subcategory. The “author” subcategory indicates that a comment is directed towards the author, most of the time by using “you” to indicate they are talking to the author (“One of the best ever!! Thank you for writing”) (Young & Beautiful chapter 34). Sometimes, a reader won’t use language that specifically indicates they are commenting towards the author, but their language will indicate that they are commenting towards the author by some level of authorial acknowledgment in the form of praise for the story (“I can't believe this is over! I've been reading it for such a long time and I loved it :) congratulations!”) (Young & Beautiful chapter 34).  The “reader” subcategory indicates that a comment is directed at a reader, mostly by directly replying to a reader’s comment on the interface, such as one reader did by replying to another reader’s comment by saying “I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY!!!!” (Young & Beautiful chapter 34). There is an “ambiguous” subcategory as well, used to indicate that a comment isn’t directed towards the author or a reader. “Ambiguous” comments are often commentary about the reader’s own life, such as one reader commenting “I didn't study to finish this story. Why do I do this” (Young & Beautiful chapter 33).</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The “scope” category is used to determine the scope of the comment, or what the comment is about. The “story” subcategory indicates that the comment is about the story, such as a reader inquiring about translating a story into a different language or expressing their love for a story by commenting “What a lovely end to a beautiful story. I loved it so so so much. Well done. :)” (Young & Beautiful chapter 34). The “canon” subcategory indicates that a comment references a story’s canon or source material. In the case of my project, canon is One Direction, and comments referencing the band, events in the band’s history, and the band’s members would fall into the “canon” subcategory. For example, one reader acknowledges that they are reading the story on Louis’s birthday, commenting “You broke my heart on Louis' birthday. I think I'm gonna go find a nice corner now, and have a cry.” (Young & Beautiful chapter 31). The “real life” subcategory references other “real life” aspects of the story not explicitly related to One Direction. For example, a reader might comment on how they found a story on social media (“Thank you, found mention of this story today on Twitter and have just read it straight through…”) or acknowledge an author’s reference to outside media (“ooh was that a 'unbelievers' reference?”) (Young & Beautiful chapter 6, 34). The “other media” subcategory denotes a comment whose scope is outside of the story, canon, or real life. Most of the time, comments in the “other” subcategory are more personal to the reader, such as the one below.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left block">“i absolutely flipped shit when i got the email that there was a chapter. and i do this thing, right, when i'm overwhelmed with excitement and happiness and i'm just giddy, i whisper to my self and (kinda) claw at my racing chest. "ohmygod. i love this. what ohmygod" i'll say stuff like that. and that's exactly what i did while reading this. you've got me in too deep, babe.” (Young & Beautiful chapter 27)</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Comments replying to another comment also fall into the “other media” subcategory if they devolve into side conversations having nothing to do with the story, One Direction, or real life. A good example of this is a reader asking the author to marry them by saying “Fucking marry me, Velvetoscar.” (Young & Beautiful chapter 30). Sometimes, a reader will correct their spelling from a previous comment, such as one reader commenting “*a published novel… I'm sorry. Your story has got me unable to type properly. :)” (Young & Beautiful chapter 11).</div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The “scope” category is the only category in which comments can be coded into more than one subcategory. Take the below comment, for example:</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left block">“hiii :) i'm commenting because i've just heard the song 'all about you' by birdy and i instantly thought of your fic:) so if you're still taking song recs, there's my contribution! the song's a bit 'light' for the fic i guess, but it's good.<br>also, amazing update. rollercoaster. stupid harry, amazing ending (as always) and waiting anxiously for the next chapter :) thanks x” (Young & Beautiful chapter 23)</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <br>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">This comment’s emotional sentiment is “positive” and direction is “author”, and it cannot be coded as another emotional sentiment or direction because those categories are mutually exclusive. The subcategories in the “scope” category, however, are independent of one another, meaning a comment can be multi-scoped. The comment above falls into both the “story” and “real life” scope because while the reader is commenting on the story, they also mention a song outside of the One Direction canon.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">	Interestingly, age showcases itself in the comments I am reading. It is easy to tell when a reader is younger—their comments contain spelling errors and their questions give away their age. For example, under chapter 1 of Young & Beautiful on Ao3, louiswtomlinson comments “this was okay you should of said no smut though”, to which Velvetoscar (the author), replies “I’m trash”. The reader responds to Velvetoscar by suggesting they “do a one shot wear they do it”—after Velvetoscar questions “do what?”, louiswtomlinson clarifies that it means “there [Harry and Louis’] first time having sex”. If the spelling errors didn’t give louiswtomlinson’s young age away, their innocent reference to sex does. Comments like louiswtomlinson’s showcase how a reader’s age is revealed by their online performance—since Wattpad is a younger platform, will there be more comments indicating a younger audience?</div>
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Like the members of One Direction portray their own brands, it is important to consider the fact that both tech-savvy Wattpad and nonprofit Ao3 are companies branded to attract the audience they desire. Wattpad reported that over 90% of their audience is Gen Z or Millenial. Over 60% of Archive of Our Own users were 19-29 in 2013, so the Ao3 audience is considerably older than Wattpad’s (centreoftheselights). How does the general age of an online fanfiction platform’s users contribute to what a platform’s audience wants to interact with and, in turn, how a platform’s audience interacts with one another?</div>
