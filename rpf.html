      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Shipping is a popular fannish practice, but also a controversial one, particularly so when the ship involves real people. Real person fiction, or RPF for short, is fanfiction that incorporates real people into the story. Real person slash (similarly dubbed RPS) is a subgenre of real person fiction that, like slash, features real people in stories with oftentimes fictional, same-sex relationships. The real people in RPF and RPS are most often a specific celebrity or well-known figure.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">RPF is born out of what Jennifer McGee terms a “parasocial relationship”, meaning “the relationships people feel they share with television and movie characters or celebrities” (McGee 164). The term, first used in 1956 to explain the connection many television viewers felt with television characters, helps explain why fans write real person fiction; to connect with their favorite characters. Fans know that celebrities do not know who they are as individuals, yet a celebrity’s interactions with a fandom as a whole feels personal to fans—think of musicians addressing fans as the personal “you” at concerts even though they can’t see the faces of the crowd. This leads fans to develop a relationship with a celebrity in which the fan feels all of the normal emotional feelings of a relationship yet the celebrity feels nothing because they do not know the fan exists. Traditionally, an example of this parasocial bond realizing itself in fanfiction is through the Mary Sue character, used as a way for young girls to write idealized versions of themselves into their stories. In modern fanfiction, the bond is also realized using “Y/N” in dialogue to denote the use of one’s own name, so that a reader can input themself directly into the story. If someone wrote dialogue in a fanfiction as “Y/N, you are the best cook I have ever seen!” that would indicate, in my case, that the dialogue is supposed to be read as “Hope, you are the best cook I have ever seen!”</div>

      <div class="col-lg-3"></div>
      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">The parasocial bond has become heightened by a disconnect between the brand that a celebrity has constructed for themselves and who a celebrity “really” is (or who a celebrity’s fans choose to believe they “really” are). Celebrities have been accused of fabricating their lives and personalities in order to please fannish expectations. As such, fanfiction has increasingly mixed fannish desires with the parasocial relationships fanbases have with celebrities. In other words, RPF is born out of fans expressing what they wish to be true and complicated by the fact that parasocial relationships have given fans a sense that their version of the truth is the real truth.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Real person fiction is considered by some to be a by-product of the double-edged sword of the media. In order to gain exposure and popularity, celebrities feed the parasocial relationship their fans have developed with them through fan interaction, personalization, and acknowledgment, leading fans to express these parasocial feelings through things such as celebrity conspiracy theories and real person fiction (Malik). Fans consciously continue to buy into this media cycle even while recognizing that celebrities intentionally play into their public personas to gain recognition and popularity. Fan awareness of a celebrity’s manipulation of fan emotion only serves to reinforce fannish theories, as any attempt of a celebrity to debunk a rumor is said to be lying for publicity (Malik). By asserting a celebrity’s truth isn’t actually the “real” celebrity and writing fanfiction directly in opposition to what a celebrity has stated is their truth, fans are appropriating physical bodies and personalities. Because the people being written about in real person fiction are real people, it is easier to speculate, imagine, and support fannish theories, and RPF often blurs the line between what is and isn’t true outside of the fic (Duke University, Malik, Piper). Scholars have also noted that RPF is more likely to incorporate “problematic sexual scripts and gendered behaviors” on a greater scale than traditional fanfiction (Hedrick 69). No matter how much celebrities play into the public personas their fans write about nor how legal RPF may prove to be in court, it does stand to be recognized that there are real-world implications for RPF.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Copyright laws are more strict surrounding literature and intellectual property than the protection of a public persona, meaning that real person fiction is legal and more protected than traditional fanfiction (Lantagne). Some subjects of RPF have tried to fight content written about them in a court of law, but most don’t find themselves very successful. RPF has long been accused of being illegal or libel, but the celebrity brand it is based on allows it to develop in a perfectly ethical capacity, as indicated by legal analysis of both fanfiction and Real Person Fiction (Lantagne). RPF is based on people, not on any copyrighted text, and this lack of copyright protects RPF from copyright infringement. The First Amendment allows writers to write as they see fit without platform intervention, and the lack of commercialized aspects within the fanfiction community protects RPF from trademark infringement. RPF is often widely fictional and features wildly fictional kinks such as mpreg (male pregnancy) and au (placing characters in an alternate universe) that protects RPF from privacy or publicity violations as well (Lantagne).</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">RPF incorporates more technical elements than traditional fanfiction. For example, RPF creators often use “fan cams” or video compilations with real footage of the people they are writing about, edited in order to suggestively emphasize the ship they are writing about. The videos can be embedded into a chapter in a fic, but authors also link to the original social media post of the video on Twitter or another social media website. Pictures are another popular media element utilized in RPF, edited to depict a ship cuddling, kissing, or simply posing next to one another as a couple. These elements are used to supplement written fiction; for example, authors might photoshop cutouts of clothing on a white backdrop in order to give their audience a visual picture of a character’s outfit, insert a GIF of a character's reaction to what is happening in the story, or link to a song their audience should listen to while reading a specific chapter.</div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 text-left indent">Although the RPF community is more digitally-inclined than its traditional fanfiction counterpart, there has begun a trend away from using such digital advancement as well, meaning it is important to “be alert to the specific contexts, technological and social, of individual works, and be aware of the specific tools that research in the broader field of fiction can make available.” (Fathallah 584). For this reason, I am choosing to analyze the One Direction fandom.</div>
